[Apache Fluo] and [Apache Fluo Recipes] have seperate documentation as they are different repositories with their own release cycle.

## Apache Fluo

Starting with 1.0.0-incubating, Apache Fluo will follow [semver](http://semver.org/) for all API
changes.  The API consist of evertyhing under the org.apache.fluo.api package.  Code outside of this
package can change at any time.  If your project is using Fluo code that falls outside of the API,
then consider [initiating a discussion](/getinvolved/) about adding it to the API.

Last release was `{{ site.latest_fluo_release }}` made on {{ site.latest_fluo_release_date }}.
