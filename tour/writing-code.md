Following the Fluo tour will require writing code that uses Fluo's API.  In
order to enable you to get quickly started writing Fluo code we have provided a
git repository with a basic skeleton. Before continuing with the tour, please
read about the [Fluo Tour git repository][1] and set it up locally.
