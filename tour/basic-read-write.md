title: Read and Write Data
---

The following example shows basic code for writing data using Fluo and then reading it back out.  To
run this code modify `src/main/java/ft/Main.java` in the [Fluo Tour git repository][1] and run it
following the instructions on the repository.


```java
  private static void excercise(MiniFluo mini, FluoClient client) {
    String row = "kerbalnaut0001";
    Column fName = new Column("name", "first");
    Column lName = new Column("name", "last");

    try (Transaction tx = client.newTransaction()) {
      tx.set(row, fName, "Jebediah");
      tx.set(row, lName, "Kerman");
      tx.commit();
    }

    try (Snapshot snaphot = client.newSnapshot()) {
      System.out.println("First name : " + snaphot.gets(row, fName));
      System.out.println("Last name  : " + snaphot.gets(row, lName));
    }
  }
```

In the example above a Transaction is created in a try-with-resources block.  A Transaction can read
and write data.  It can only read data that was committed before it started.  Data set on a
transaction will only be written when `commit()` is called.

A Snapshot is created to read the data previously written by the Transaction.  Snapshots only see
data committed before the snapshot was created.  The code calls [gets(CharSequence, Column)][gets] which
is a convenience method that works with strings.  Internally Fluo only deals with bytes and its
[get(Bytes, Column)][get] method returns [Bytes].   The Fluo methods that take and return Strings
assume UTF-8 encoding when converting to bytes.

Transactions and snapshots allocate resources and therefore have `close()` methods.  The
try-with-resources block will automatically call `close()`, even when exceptions occur.
